# Database of record graphs with girth 7 and 8

The database provides the record graphs that are regular of degree 3 up to 14 for degrees 7 and 8. They are the best known records to date (August 14, 2015).

NOTE: These adjacency lists can be freely used for any purpose but the original source should be cited.

The files are all of the form k4g7v67, where the first number indicates the degree, the second one the girth and the last one the order of the record graph.

Each file contains a line with the neighbours of the vertex with the corresponding line number. So the first line in the file k4g7v67 
		1	33	57	66
indicates that vertex number 0 has neighbours 1,33,57 and 66.

	3	     | 24    |	(McGee)
	4	     | 67    |	(Exoo, McKay, Myrvold and Nadon)	
	5	     | 152   |	(McKay and Yuanshen)
	6	     | 294   |	(McKay and Yuanshen)
	7	     | 632	  | (de Ruiter and Biggs)
	8	     | 777   | (de Ruiter and Biggs)
	9	     | 1104  | (de Ruiter and Biggs)
	10      |	1611  | (de Ruiter and Biggs)
	11	    | 2596  | (de Ruiter and Biggs)
	12	    | 2893  | (de Ruiter and Biggs)
	13	    | 4292  | (de Ruiter and Biggs)
	14	    | 4719  | (de Ruiter and Biggs)

For degrees 4 and 6 our construction yielded graphs of order 70 and 295 respectively. These have also been added to the database, but as seen from the table above are not record graphs.
